An example being an IEC socket mount which bolts onto an aluminium 3030 extrusion. These parts are developed but do not belong to any particular product we provide. This section will serve as a home to all of those designs, so that members of the community can use them if they find the need. We provide both STEP and STL files for each, ready to be printed or added into your own mods. Upcoming & Prototype Products \u00b6 From prototypes early in the development process, to designs nearing to official announcement and release. This section houses projects which we aim to make commercially available. Non-commercial Designs \u00b6 The research and development process does not always result in a product that is commercially viable at the time. This section contains those designs which did not become a product we currently sell, but that we may revisit in the future. We share and document these designs, as well as the ideas and timelines behind them in this section. You can also find CAD models and the bill of materials should someone wish to build the design for themselves. Discontinued Products \u00b6 Products are sometimes superseded with new and improved versions, or simply no longer sell and are discontinued. Here you can find products which fall into these categories. We provide the CAD models, and the full bill of materials, so that these designs are never lost. CAD Repository \u00b6 Most of the components we use in our CAD models are modelled in-house. This section is a repository of those CAD models which are available for the community to use in their own designs. By using our official models, you can be assured that the design you create will match the product you can purchase.

It was intended to be an incremental update, improving upon certain areas, rather than being a full redesign. Due to the original V-Cast 1.0 being discontinued, this update never saw the light of day as a commercial product.

The design goal was to create an enclosure which only needed regular square panels, which would be cheaper and easier to acquire. Ultimately this resulted in several issues with machine maintenance, and as such was not chosen for the enclosure design.

The design goal was to create an enclosure which only needed regular square panels, which would be cheaper and easier to acquire. The design was ultimately abandoned due to multiple issues with machine maintenance when the panels are installed in such a way: Removing any of the side panels required partial disassembly of the machine frame, which was likely to cause the CoreXY system to need realignment The width of the frame increased by 60mm due to the use of 3060 extrusions on the sides The weight of the frame increased considerably due to the requirement of 3060 extrusions in various places Ultimately, due to the issues mentioned above, this design was abandoned in favour of one which used panels screwed to the frame.

The design goal was to create an enclosure which only needed regular square panels, which would be cheaper and easier to acquire. The design was ultimately abandoned due to multiple issues with machine maintenance when the panels are installed in such a way: Removing any of the side panels required partial disassembly of the machine frame, which was likely to cause the CoreXY system to need realignment The width of the frame increased by 60mm due to the use of 3060 extrusions on the sides The weight of the frame increased considerably due to the requirement of 3060 extrusions in various places Ultimately, due to the issues mentioned above, this design was abandoned in favour of one which used panels screwed to the frame.","title":"About the V-Core 3.1 \"Beast\" Enclosure"},{"location":"vc31_beast_enclosure/#development-timeline","text":"11/10/2022 - Added to Rat Rig Lab 21/07/2022 - Prototype design complete 18/07/2022 - Prototyping","title":"Development Timeline"},{"location":"vc31_beast_enclosure/#gallery","text":"","title":"Gallery"},{"location":"vc31_beast_enclosure/#cad","text":"Click here to view the CAD on the Rat Rig Fusion 360 viewer","title":"CAD"},{"location":"vc31_beast_enclosure/#bill-of-materials","text":"BOM Limitations The bill of materials below is based upon a full machine build with a 300x300x300 print volume.

Variants \u00b6 Due to the space constraints caused by requiring two EVA tool heads, the IDEX V-Core 3.1 was developed into two separate designs. This page details the design which maintains the same external dimensions as the existing V-Core 3 sizes. This comes at the expense of a reduced build volume in X and Y. The alternate design, unofficially dubbed the \"wide boy\", increases the frame size in the X-axis direction, but maintains the original print volume. Details of the \"wide boy\" design can be found on its own page accessed by clicking here . Kinematics \u00b6 Adaptions to the kinematics were required to make IDEX work on the V-Core 3.1. The kinematics chosen are widely known as \"Dual Markforge\" kinematics. Two NEMA17 new stepper motors are used to drive the Y-axis (one per side), and then the existing A/B NEMA17 steppers are used to drive the two tool heads.

The wider frame, unofficially dubbed the \"wide boy\", was created to allow the extruder(s) to completely leave the print volume when not in use. This is important for the IDEX configuration as it allows both extruders to reach all points on the print bed, thus enabling the full print volume in multi-colour or multi-material prints. Kinematics \u00b6 The V-Cast uses standard Cartesian kinematics. Unofficially these are often referred to as \"bed slingers\", as the print bed (and as such the print itself) moves in the Y direction during operation.

It was intended to be an incremental update, rather than a full redesign. It improved upon the original in several ways: Complete redesign of the X-axis transmission for both single and IDEX configurations Relocated the X and U-axis motors to be inside the frame, decreasing the total width of the machine by 62mm in IDEX New three point rigid bed mounting, using the same machined bed plates as the V-Core 3 Updated Y-axis carriage, which is stronger, yet lighter Addition of a second Y-axis motor for additional torque when moving the bed Addition of axial thrust bearings & pillow blocks to both Z-axis motor assemblies Variants \u00b6 The V-Cast 1.5 features the same two variants as the V-Cast 1.0, both of which can be used with either a single extruder, or a pair of extruders for IDEX. The wider frame, unofficially dubbed the \"wide boy\", was created to allow the extruder(s) to completely leave the print volume when not in use. This is important for the IDEX configuration as it allows both extruders to reach all points on the print bed, thus enabling the full print volume in multi-colour or multi-material prints. Kinematics \u00b6 The V-Cast uses standard Cartesian kinematics. Unofficially these are often referred to as \"bed slingers\", as the print bed (and as such the print itself) moves in the Y direction during operation.

It was intended to be an incremental update, rather than a full redesign. It improved upon the original in several ways: Complete redesign of the X-axis transmission for both single and IDEX configurations Relocated the X and U-axis motors to be inside the frame, decreasing the total width of the machine by 62mm in IDEX New three point rigid bed mounting, using the same machined bed plates as the V-Core 3 Updated Y-axis carriage, which is stronger, yet lighter Addition of a second Y-axis motor for additional torque when moving the bed Addition of axial thrust bearings & pillow blocks to both Z-axis motor assemblies","title":"About the V-Cast 1.5"},{"location":"vcast_1_5/#variants","text":"The V-Cast 1.5 features the same two variants as the V-Cast 1.0, both of which can be used with either a single extruder, or a pair of extruders for IDEX. The wider frame, unofficially dubbed the \"wide boy\", was created to allow the extruder(s) to completely leave the print volume when not in use.
