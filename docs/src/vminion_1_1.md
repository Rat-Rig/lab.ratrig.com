## About the V-Minion 1.1 Alpha
The V-Minion 1.1 was developed as an upgrade to the original V-Minion 1.0 design. It was intended to be an incremental update, rather than a full redesign. It improved upon the original in several ways:

- Removal of the external electronics enclosure, integrating them onto the V-Minion frame in a fully printed enclosure
- Addition of electronics cooling on the new enclosure
- Support for the BigTreeTech SKRat V1.0 motherboard
- Updated toolhead design, based upon the Rat Rig toolhead featured on the V-Core 3.1 and V-Core 4.0
- Improved routing and support of the bed cables
- Integrated lead screw decoupler on the Z-axis

### Kinematics
The V-Minion uses standard Cartesian kinematics. Unofficially these are often referred to as "bed slingers", as the print bed (and as such the print itself) moves in the Y direction during operation. As the Z-axis is only supported at one end, the V-Minion is considered to be a cantilevered design.
