{{ rr_build_project_entry(
  "vc31_idex",
  "Prototype", 
  "The IDEX (or Independent Dual Extruder) version of the V-Core 3.1 was designed, in part, to fill the gap left by the discontinuation of the Rat Rig V-Cast.
  
  This variant features a reduced build volume which allows the external dimensions of the machine to match the non-IDEX counterpart."
