Sometimes we need a particular part which we design and use internally, but they do not belong to any particular product. A good example is an IEC socket mount which bolts onto an aluminium 3030 extrusion. Below we share these parts, and other modifications we develop, so that members of the community can use them if they find the need.

We provide both STEP and STL files, ready to be printed or added into your own CAD models.
