### V-Cast 1.5
{{ rr_build_project_entry(
  "vcast_1_5",
  "Non-commercial", 
  "The V-Cast 1.5 was developed as an upgrade to the original V-Cast 1.0 design. It was intended to be an incremental update, improving upon certain areas, rather than being a full redesign.
  
  Due to the original V-Cast 1.0 being discontinued, this update never saw the light of day as a commercial product."

### V-Core 3.1 "Beast" Enclosure
{{ rr_build_project_entry(
  "vc31_beast_enclosure",
  "Non-commercial", 
  "This prototype was created during the development of the 2.0 enclosure for the V-Core 3.1. The design goal was to create an enclosure which only needed regular square panels, which would be cheaper and easier to acquire.
  
  Ultimately this resulted in several issues with machine maintenance, and as such was not chosen for the enclosure design."
